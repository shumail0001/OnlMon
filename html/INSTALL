To get html output browsing working, all you have to do is to copy all this directory content to a web server, and let this server handle CGI scripts. 
For Apache, this is a matter of editing the configuration file (generally located in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf) by adding the lines :

# All .cgi files will be treated as CGI scripts
AddHandle cgi-script .cgi

# Allow CGI scripts in the directory you chose
<Directory /dir/to/script/>
  Options ExecCGI
  Order Allow, Deny
  Allow from All
</Directory>

Then the entry point is 

http://youwebserver.com/you_script_dir/mon.cgi?runselect=1

and off you go !

Help on the mon.cgi script is inside the script.

Note that look and feel can be changed using the Cascading Style Sheet file mon.css

Enjoy !
